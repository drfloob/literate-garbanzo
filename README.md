## 1. Introduction

Think Facebook and Linkedin. These are giant networks, growing by the
minute, and they play a key role in many of our lives. It's been the
case that if you want to do something interesting on the data that
drives these networks, you have to round up all your Petabytes in one
go and process it all over hours, if not days!

**Network Pulse is a distributed, fault-tolerant big data pipeline
that performs graph analysis over unbounded data streams. Streaming
graph analysis at the pace of change.** Its goal is to find clusters
of people who interact with each other, as they interact.

With this information, we can find who the most influential people are
as they develop their influence. We can recommend new connections when
the connections are most relevant. We can predict who would most
likely bridge two separate groups, and use that information to
strengthen a community when the momentum of interaction is at its
peak.

complaint.
